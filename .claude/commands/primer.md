## Your task

If the `tree` command is unavailable, stop here and suggest the user to install the `tree` command via homebrew (`brew install tree`).

Begin with reading the root @CLAUDE.md, @README.md, and all linked files from within to get a full understanding of the project..

Explain back to me with a comprehensive understanding of the following:
